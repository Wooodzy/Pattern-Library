# Creating a Pattern Library. 

Pastel Pattern Library is a pattern library that has been created from scratch using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It uses a constant pastel colour palette for the elements to create a subtle but vibrant theme for developers to utilize when creating their own projects. 

## Introduction

Pattern libraries are a catalogue of different elements that are intended for reuse, the elements are often tested with the benefit of efficiency. Allowing designers and developers to create projects quicker as the solution to what they need has already been created.  Pattern libraries can contain a range of different elements that be dragged and dropped into a project as the library usually comes with a CSS file to style the elements. 

#### Usual Components:

* Index Template.
* Button styles.
* Jumbotrons.
* Navigation system.
* Footers/Headers.
* Grid layout.
* Icons
* Utility classes.

All elements should be clearly described to give the user the right information of use. A pattern library standard is displaying elements along with the supporting code allowing developers to quickly grab the elements to use.

Pattern libraries are often used by businesses to create a company standard across all platforms online, the libraries will be specific for each platform but will they will all have a consistent theme throughout keeping the standards of the business to a maximum to maintain a professional look. 

### Project Aim

The project aim is to create a pastel pattern library that can be used to quickly create a website for developers or users. The library will be displayed with clarity and elegance with the attention being brought mainly to the elements on the page. I will also research and look into other pattern library to understand the industry standard that is currently being used by other developers. 

### Research

Styleguides.io is a website that holds many different pattern library that are free for users to use and experiment with. The design libraries on the site range in the amount of content that is on them, one of the biggest library that is available to users, is a  pattern library by IMB. Carbon is IBM's free and open-source design and pattern library for digital products, the library is very consistent throughout and a range of different components, resources and guidelines that IBM follow themselves to create their brand.

Carbon also lists all the different variations of the element in different code along the top of the code box which gives the library a lot more utilization. it also lists different scenarios you can use the elements to help developers maintain consistency, the library also provides the JavaScript and extra modifiers to be able to customise the use of the elements. Other libraries such as Starbucks and Code for America have very different layouts compared to IBM.

This is Code for America's pattern library, its a long list of elements all on one page, with drop down code example for each of the elements.

This is an example of Starbucks code example and element, they have a long list of bullet points that are hyperlinked to the code and the element but the library has not been updated since 2014.

#### Pattern library tools

There are many pattern library that make it easier to create a library, but these usually come with certain constraints like using the tools that are provided can cause developers themes or styles for the elements to be similar but it will help maintain consistency but lack originality. 

##### Pattern Library tools:

* Astrum. 
* Bootstrap.
* Barebones.
* Pattern Lab.
* Snack.
  

#### Creating my own Library.

I decided to create my own library instead of using another framework or tool, depending on the tool or program used to assist it could possibly constrain how users interact with my library and having complete control over the elements will give me more freedom when designing the components. I will mainly use HTML, CSS and JavaScript, to create the elements, style and animate them to suit the library consistently throughout. 

I will take design inspirations from googles material design mixed with pastel colours to keep a subtle feel and try to create an organic environment for the elements to create a set of building blocks to build sleek websites. 

### Design Process Method.

The 5 stage model of design helps designers understand the problem, generate ideas, prototype and experiment with the ideas and then to test and evolve those ideas into something more. This can be used towards my design pattern as the stages will help my library grow over time. 

The design process will be identify what needs to be done come up with a solution, experiment with the solution until it fits the correct aesthetic and feel of the pattern library. Test the solution (elements) and then build upon the elements to create a larger library with more functionality and usability. ![designmethod](D:\Uni\Web Design for industry\Framework\designmethod.png)

### Test Plan

Testing and why
The elements have to be tested to make sure they are faultless and can be reused effortlessly as the building blocks for other developers projects. The functionality of the elements need to be correct as the last thing users are going to want to do is to debug a pattern library that is advertised as working correctly. 

The CSS will be checked alongside the HTML code samples to provide reassurance to all parties that the services provided are working correctly. There will be a test plan produced to test all of the elements to incase of syntax errors or spelling mistakes in the class names.
